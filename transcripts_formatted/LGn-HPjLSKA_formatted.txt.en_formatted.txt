[00:30:30.350] me bring Ryan in on that
[00:30:30.360] me bring Ryan in on that one I think with the January 6 you're
[00:30:32.509] one I think with the January 6 you're
[00:30:32.519] one I think with the January 6 you're talking about several hundred if not
[00:30:34.470] talking about several hundred if not
[00:30:34.480] talking about several hundred if not several thousand people um and I think
[00:30:36.509] several thousand people um and I think
[00:30:36.519] several thousand people um and I think the question is is I don't think that he
[00:30:38.669] the question is is I don't think that he
[00:30:38.679] the question is is I don't think that he should pardon anyone who did something
[00:30:39.950] should pardon anyone who did something
[00:30:39.960] should pardon anyone who did something violent I don't think that attack but I
[00:30:41.549] violent I don't think that attack but I
[00:30:41.559] violent I don't think that attack but I do think that when you look at the
[00:30:43.470] do think that when you look at the
[00:30:43.480] do think that when you look at the sentencing in how some January 6 people
[00:30:45.269] sentencing in how some January 6 people
[00:30:45.279] sentencing in how some January 6 people have been treated is remarkable
[00:30:47.830] have been treated is remarkable
[00:30:47.840] have been treated is remarkable considering some people have solitary
[00:30:49.070] considering some people have solitary
[00:30:49.080] considering some people have solitary confinement from months on end people
[00:30:50.710] confinement from months on end people
[00:30:50.720] confinement from months on end people are treated much worse doing a January
[00:30:52.710] are treated much worse doing a January
[00:30:52.720] are treated much worse doing a January 6th of than and a than you know a
[00:30:54.350] 6th of than and a than you know a
[00:30:54.360] 6th of than and a than you know a murderer so I do think that depending on
[00:30:57.350] murderer so I do think that depending on
[00:30:57.360] murderer so I do think that depending on what they are accused of and what they
[00:30:59.110] what they are accused of and what they
[00:30:59.120] what they are accused of and what they have been tried on I think a pardon is
[00:31:01.310] have been tried on I think a pardon is
[00:31:01.320] have been tried on I think a pardon is could could be warranted I don't think
[00:31:03.269] could could be warranted I don't think
[00:31:03.279] could could be warranted I don't think that anyone who violently attacks
[00:31:04.789] that anyone who violently attacks
[00:31:04.799] that anyone who violently attacks somebody should be pardoned though so if
[00:31:06.909] somebody should be pardoned though so if
[00:31:06.919] somebody should be pardoned though so if they so if they go to pardon the people
[00:31:08.230] they so if they go to pardon the people
[00:31:08.240] they so if they go to pardon the people convicted of seditious conspiracy that
[00:31:10.149] convicted of seditious conspiracy that
[00:31:10.159] convicted of seditious conspiracy that weren't involved in direct violent
[00:31:11.430] weren't involved in direct violent
[00:31:11.440] weren't involved in direct violent activity you would support those

[00:35:00.640] buz for a moment thank you Lindy here's my point is that it's not just about
[00:35:02.950] my point is that it's not just about
[00:35:02.960] my point is that it's not just about Hunter Biden being dragged into
[00:35:05.190] Hunter Biden being dragged into
[00:35:05.200] Hunter Biden being dragged into something the laptop contained evidence
[00:35:07.550] something the laptop contained evidence
[00:35:07.560] something the laptop contained evidence of crimes and it was suppressed from the
[00:35:10.190] of crimes and it was suppressed from the
[00:35:10.200] of crimes and it was suppressed from the media uh in that two we period before
[00:35:12.870] media uh in that two we period before
[00:35:12.880] media uh in that two we period before that election and that is a much bigger
[00:35:15.349] that election and that is a much bigger
[00:35:15.359] that election and that is a much bigger picture than whether Hunter Biden got
[00:35:17.310] picture than whether Hunter Biden got
[00:35:17.320] picture than whether Hunter Biden got pulled into
[00:35:18.790] pulled into
[00:35:18.800] pulled into politics right and I think this is not
[00:35:21.470] politics right and I think this is not
[00:35:21.480] politics right and I think this is not just an act of love it wasn't just a
[00:35:23.790] just an act of love it wasn't just a
[00:35:23.800] just an act of love it wasn't just a father's compassion it was almost
[00:35:25.430] father's compassion it was almost
[00:35:25.440] father's compassion it was almost perhaps even an act of self-preservation
[00:35:27.990] perhaps even an act of self-preservation
[00:35:28.000] perhaps even an act of self-preservation because we don't know what happened in
[00:35:29.670] because we don't know what happened in
[00:35:29.680] because we don't know what happened in those 11 years it's covered everything
[00:35:31.630] those 11 years it's covered everything
[00:35:31.640] those 11 years it's covered everything from 2014 to December 1st 2024 so this
[00:35:36.550] from 2014 to December 1st 2024 so this
[00:35:36.560] from 2014 to December 1st 2024 so this whole thing is gigantic and I think in
[00:35:38.910] whole thing is gigantic and I think in
[00:35:38.920] whole thing is gigantic and I think in the next couple weeks we're going to see
[00:35:41.109] the next couple weeks we're going to see
[00:35:41.119] the next couple weeks we're going to see more pardons coming out I think this is
[00:35:42.990] more pardons coming out I think this is
[00:35:43.000] more pardons coming out I think this is really just the tip of the iceberg my
[00:35:45.069] really just the tip of the iceberg my
[00:35:45.079] really just the tip of the iceberg my guess would be that he might even pardon
[00:35:46.790] guess would be that he might even pardon
[00:35:46.800] guess would be that he might even pardon people who were involved in Hunter's
