[00:17:52.710] to execute things because in the midst
[00:17:52.720] to execute things because in the midst of this act of kindness trying to solve
[00:17:55.390] of this act of kindness trying to solve
[00:17:55.400] of this act of kindness trying to solve a short-term crisis we've created
[00:17:57.590] a short-term crisis we've created

[00:22:52.190] in person and my experience there was
[00:22:52.200] in person and my experience there was nothing like the narratives I seen
[00:22:53.789] nothing like the narratives I seen
[00:22:53.799] nothing like the narratives I seen growing up watching stuff you know on TV
[00:22:56.430] growing up watching stuff you know on TV
[00:22:56.440] growing up watching stuff you know on TV and commercials and I think about you
[00:22:58.630] and commercials and I think about you
[00:22:58.640] and commercials and I think about you know the fact of that impact right you
[00:23:00.789] know the fact of that impact right you
[00:23:00.799] know the fact of that impact right you said 40 years ago we got a president um
[00:23:03.630] said 40 years ago we got a president um
[00:23:03.640] said 40 years ago we got a president um you know elect that referred to African
[00:23:06.149] you know elect that referred to African
[00:23:06.159] you know elect that referred to African countries as hole countries and
[00:23:08.669] countries as hole countries and
[00:23:08.679] countries as hole countries and part of what he was thinking was the
[00:23:10.870] part of what he was thinking was the
[00:23:10.880] part of what he was thinking was the types of images that we've seen growing
[00:23:12.909] types of images that we've seen growing
[00:23:12.919] types of images that we've seen growing up of Africa being depicted in the type
[00:23:15.070] up of Africa being depicted in the type
[00:23:15.080] up of Africa being depicted in the type of way that it is and so for me it's
[00:23:17.909] of way that it is and so for me it's
[00:23:17.919] of way that it is and so for me it's like there's other ways to counter The
[00:23:20.630] like there's other ways to counter The
[00:23:20.640] like there's other ways to counter The Narrative I think that while it can be
[00:23:22.510] Narrative I think that while it can be
[00:23:22.520] Narrative I think that while it can be compelling to see people impoverished
[00:23:24.549] compelling to see people impoverished
[00:23:24.559] compelling to see people impoverished and all these things if that is the bulk
[00:23:26.590] and all these things if that is the bulk
[00:23:26.600] and all these things if that is the bulk of the majority of the narratives that
[00:23:27.990] of the majority of the narratives that
[00:23:28.000] of the majority of the narratives that we're seeing usually of one particular
[00:23:30.110] we're seeing usually of one particular
[00:23:30.120] we're seeing usually of one particular area of the world constantly even when
[00:23:32.750] area of the world constantly even when
[00:23:32.760] area of the world constantly even when we're not asking for charity then you
[00:23:34.590] we're not asking for charity then you
[00:23:34.600] we're not asking for charity then you got to mix it up and do something better
[00:23:37.269] got to mix it up and do something better
[00:23:37.279] got to mix it up and do something better let me bring in the because you've been
[00:23:38.710] let me bring in the because you've been
[00:23:38.720] let me bring in the because you've been waiting patiently what do you think of
[00:23:40.029] waiting patiently what do you think of
[00:23:40.039] waiting patiently what do you think of this
[00:23:41.310] this
[00:23:41.320] this debate uh I think it's interesting being
[00:23:43.510] debate uh I think it's interesting being
[00:23:43.520] debate uh I think it's interesting being an expert in Africa myself never been
[00:23:45.789] an expert in Africa myself never been
[00:23:45.799] an expert in Africa myself never been there but uh I would say um uh starving
[00:23:50.830] there but uh I would say um uh starving
[00:23:50.840] there but uh I would say um uh starving children should be the priority no
[00:23:52.909] children should be the priority no
[00:23:52.919] children should be the priority no matter where they are and fixing that
[00:23:54.870] matter where they are and fixing that
[00:23:54.880] matter where they are and fixing that problem Pride I would swallow that I
[00:23:58.070] problem Pride I would swallow that I
[00:23:58.080] problem Pride I would swallow that I understand the perception maybe I think
[00:23:59.630] understand the perception maybe I think
[00:23:59.640] understand the perception maybe I think there's a reasonable conclusion we could
[00:24:01.950] there's a reasonable conclusion we could
[00:24:01.960] there's a reasonable conclusion we could come here we could talk about the region
[00:24:03.710] come here we could talk about the region
[00:24:03.720] come here we could talk about the region maybe and not you know because there
[00:24:05.549] maybe and not you know because there
[00:24:05.559] maybe and not you know because there  hole countries it's not exclusive
[00:24:07.350]  hole countries it's not exclusive
