[00:11:43.230] I mean could the two things be true at
[00:11:43.240] I mean could the two things be true at the same time yes it suits Netanyahu and
[00:11:46.110] the same time yes it suits Netanyahu and
[00:11:46.120] the same time yes it suits Netanyahu and his bigger view of the region I'm sure
[00:11:48.269] his bigger view of the region I'm sure
[00:11:48.279] his bigger view of the region I'm sure that's true um but it could also be
[00:11:50.990] that's true um but it could also be
[00:11:51.000] that's true um but it could also be absolutely in
[00:11:52.990] absolutely in

[00:11:57.870] interests to do this I mean I don't
[00:11:57.880] interests to do this I mean I don't agree with them but it could it be that
[00:11:59.790] agree with them but it could it be that
[00:11:59.800] agree with them but it could it be that that is a genuine belief on their
[00:12:03.509] that is a genuine belief on their
[00:12:03.519] that is a genuine belief on their part I I agree with you that it's absurd
[00:12:07.350] part I I agree with you that it's absurd
[00:12:07.360] part I I agree with you that it's absurd because what has it gotten us7 trillion
[00:12:10.990] because what has it gotten us7 trillion
[00:12:11.000] because what has it gotten us7 trillion dollars of War spending massive debts
[00:12:15.230] dollars of War spending massive debts

[00:12:29.269] than 25 years now and so it doesn't
[00:12:29.279] than 25 years now and so it doesn't accomplish anything I think it's
[00:12:31.350] accomplish anything I think it's
[00:12:31.360] accomplish anything I think it's extremely naive and I think it's

[00:22:27.950] interestingly um president zalinski at
[00:22:27.960] interestingly um president zalinski at the weekend an interview with Stuart
[00:22:29.510] the weekend an interview with Stuart
[00:22:29.520] the weekend an interview with Stuart Ramsey at Sky News said
[00:22:32.149] Ramsey at Sky News said
[00:22:32.159] Ramsey at Sky News said this one alternative perhaps uh again
[00:22:35.590] this one alternative perhaps uh again
[00:22:35.600] this one alternative perhaps uh again this is is is reported from the United
[00:22:37.310] this is is is reported from the United
[00:22:37.320] this is is is reported from the United States and it's fairly simple really is
[00:22:39.789] States and it's fairly simple really is
[00:22:39.799] States and it's fairly simple really is that Ukraine joins
[00:22:42.549] that Ukraine joins
[00:22:42.559] that Ukraine joins NATO but
[00:22:44.669] NATO but
[00:22:44.679] NATO but Russia takes control and keeps the land
[00:22:47.470] Russia takes control and keeps the land
[00:22:47.480] Russia takes control and keeps the land that it has to
[00:22:49.669] that it has to
[00:22:49.679] that it has to date would that be a
[00:22:58.750] possibility no one has offered us to be
[00:22:58.760] possibility no one has offered us to be in NATO with just one part or another
[00:23:01.390] in NATO with just one part or another
[00:23:01.400] in NATO with just one part or another part of
[00:23:02.750] part of
[00:23:02.760] part of Ukraine that's for once the fact is that
[00:23:06.750] Ukraine that's for once the fact is that
[00:23:06.760] Ukraine that's for once the fact is that it is a solution to stop the hot stage
[00:23:08.950] it is a solution to stop the hot stage
[00:23:08.960] it is a solution to stop the hot stage of the war because we can just give the
[00:23:12.350] of the war because we can just give the
[00:23:12.360] of the war because we can just give the NATO membership to the part of Ukraine
[00:23:14.350] NATO membership to the part of Ukraine
[00:23:14.360] NATO membership to the part of Ukraine that is under our
[00:23:20.710] control yes it could be possible but no
[00:23:20.720] control yes it could be possible but no one offer it what struck me is most
[00:23:23.789] one offer it what struck me is most
[00:23:23.799] one offer it what struck me is most interesting about that when I
[00:23:24.789] interesting about that when I
[00:23:24.799] interesting about that when I interviewed zalinski uh two years ago in
[00:23:27.510] interviewed zalinski uh two years ago in
[00:23:27.520] interviewed zalinski uh two years ago in ke he was never he said prepared to even

[00:23:44.070] that and what does it all
[00:23:44.080] that and what does it all mean well it doesn't mean very much
[00:23:46.710] mean well it doesn't mean very much
[00:23:46.720] mean well it doesn't mean very much because it puts everything uh upside
[00:23:48.909] because it puts everything uh upside

[00:24:03.909] goes back 30 years it goes back to a
[00:24:03.919] goes back 30 years it goes back to a very bad idea of is big binski uh who
[00:24:07.070] very bad idea of is big binski uh who
[00:24:07.080] very bad idea of is big binski uh who wrote and described all of this in

[00:24:29.950] course wrongly but he analyzes in detail
[00:24:29.960] course wrongly but he analyzes in detail in one of the chapters of the book that
[00:24:31.990] in one of the chapters of the book that
[00:24:32.000] in one of the chapters of the book that Russia has no choice it will never side
