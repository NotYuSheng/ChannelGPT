[00:16:52.269] going to lose the Russian army
[00:16:52.279] going to lose the Russian army historically does very poorly when it
[00:16:54.990] historically does very poorly when it
[00:16:55.000] historically does very poorly when it goes into another country but when the
[00:16:56.829] goes into another country but when the
[00:16:56.839] goes into another country but when the war is a matter of honest borders are
[00:16:59.629] war is a matter of honest borders are
[00:16:59.639] war is a matter of honest borders are inside Russia it never loses whether
[00:17:02.790] inside Russia it never loses whether
[00:17:02.800] inside Russia it never loses whether it's this reminds me so much of the 1939
[00:17:05.750] it's this reminds me so much of the 1939
[00:17:05.760] it's this reminds me so much of the 1939 uh winter War everybody said Russia was
[00:17:08.590] uh winter War everybody said Russia was
[00:17:08.600] uh winter War everybody said Russia was completely incompetent they went into
[00:17:10.150] completely incompetent they went into
[00:17:10.160] completely incompetent they went into Finland they lost a half a million
[00:17:11.669] Finland they lost a half a million
[00:17:11.679] Finland they lost a half a million people Manheim and the fins were so
[00:17:14.069] people Manheim and the fins were so
[00:17:14.079] people Manheim and the fins were so heroic and what happened the fins
[00:17:16.549] heroic and what happened the fins
[00:17:16.559] heroic and what happened the fins finally were ground down and had to make
[00:17:18.270] finally were ground down and had to make
[00:17:18.280] finally were ground down and had to make a deal and that was worse off than when
[00:17:20.710] a deal and that was worse off than when
[00:17:20.720] a deal and that was worse off than when uh the Russ when they first started
[00:17:22.350] uh the Russ when they first started
[00:17:22.360] uh the Russ when they first started fighting Russia so I I think that's what
[00:17:24.710] fighting Russia so I I think that's what
[00:17:24.720] fighting Russia so I I think that's what we're going to see the other thing is as
[00:17:27.549] we're going to see the other thing is as
[00:17:27.559] we're going to see the other thing is as I was going to say the combined dead
[00:17:29.909] I was going to say the combined dead
[00:17:29.919] I was going to say the combined dead wounded and missing on both sides are
[00:17:31.590] wounded and missing on both sides are
[00:17:31.600] wounded and missing on both sides are about a million and a half and this is
[00:17:34.590] about a million and a half and this is
[00:17:34.600] about a million and a half and this is there's about 12,000 12 million refugees
[00:17:38.190] there's about 12,000 12 million refugees
[00:17:38.200] there's about 12,000 12 million refugees missing from Ukraine they're running out
[00:17:39.950] missing from Ukraine they're running out
[00:17:39.960] missing from Ukraine they're running out of people this is well beyond the battle
[00:17:42.190] of people this is well beyond the battle
[00:17:42.200] of people this is well beyond the battle of the Sumer Bardon in your this is the
[00:17:44.669] of the Sumer Bardon in your this is the
[00:17:44.679] of the Sumer Bardon in your this is the worst blood bath in Europe since 1942
[00:17:47.630] worst blood bath in Europe since 1942
[00:17:47.640] worst blood bath in Europe since 1942 and 43 at Stalingrad and I don't think
[00:17:50.270] and 43 at Stalingrad and I don't think
[00:17:50.280] and 43 at Stalingrad and I don't think people ever talk about that they don't
[00:17:52.029] people ever talk about that they don't
[00:17:52.039] people ever talk about that they don't you know and here in America will say
[00:17:53.909] you know and here in America will say
[00:17:53.919] you know and here in America will say well we're winning we've got to give
[00:17:55.350] well we're winning we've got to give
[00:17:55.360] well we're winning we've got to give this and this but nobody says you're
[00:17:56.830] this and this but nobody says you're
[00:17:56.840] this and this but nobody says you're destroying Ukraine in your own way to
[00:17:58.909] destroying Ukraine in your own way to
[00:17:58.919] destroying Ukraine in your own way to save it and so there has to and I think
[00:18:00.950] save it and so there has to and I think
[00:18:00.960] save it and so there has to and I think Trump is the only major figure that has
[00:18:03.549] Trump is the only major figure that has
[00:18:03.559] Trump is the only major figure that has the ability to stop it without just
[00:18:06.390] the ability to stop it without just
[00:18:06.400] the ability to stop it without just letting Putin take over the country
[00:18:09.350] letting Putin take over the country
[00:18:09.360] letting Putin take over the country finally Victor I mean there's a lot
[00:18:11.190] finally Victor I mean there's a lot
[00:18:11.200] finally Victor I mean there's a lot going on in the world but actually
[00:18:13.789] going on in the world but actually
[00:18:13.799] going on in the world but actually historically oddly perversely perhaps
[00:18:16.710] historically oddly perversely perhaps
[00:18:16.720] historically oddly perversely perhaps there are fewer wars being fought right
[00:18:18.669] there are fewer wars being fought right
[00:18:18.679] there are fewer wars being fought right now than in recorded history uh people
[00:18:21.110] now than in recorded history uh people

[00:21:03.310] you know he in fact if you go back to
[00:21:03.320] you know he in fact if you go back to Trump and what he was saying 20 years
[00:21:04.950] Trump and what he was saying 20 years
[00:21:04.960] Trump and what he was saying 20 years ago there's not a lot of difference in
[00:21:06.669] ago there's not a lot of difference in
[00:21:06.679] ago there's not a lot of difference in terms of his worldview he's just in a

[00:21:12.029] and I I think having spoken to him a few
[00:21:12.039] and I I think having spoken to him a few times recently but particularly
[00:21:13.149] times recently but particularly
[00:21:13.159] times recently but particularly yesterday that he recognizes the scale
[00:21:15.510] yesterday that he recognizes the scale
[00:21:15.520] yesterday that he recognizes the scale of the opportunity and he is much more
[00:21:18.590] of the opportunity and he is much more
[00:21:18.600] of the opportunity and he is much more relaxed than he was the first time round
[00:21:21.190] relaxed than he was the first time round
[00:21:21.200] relaxed than he was the first time round because not everyone is attacking him in
[00:21:23.310] because not everyone is attacking him in

[00:21:28.590] shouting about him actually there's been
[00:21:28.600] shouting about him actually there's been an acceptance okay he won fair and
[00:21:30.909] an acceptance okay he won fair and
[00:21:30.919] an acceptance okay he won fair and square and he won big and he has a

[00:21:37.720] right across the Spectrum uh want him to succeed it's a very different mindset
[00:21:39.630] succeed it's a very different mindset
[00:21:39.640] succeed it's a very different mindset for someone like Trump who's a pugilist
[00:21:41.710] for someone like Trump who's a pugilist
[00:21:41.720] for someone like Trump who's a pugilist at heart but actually if you
