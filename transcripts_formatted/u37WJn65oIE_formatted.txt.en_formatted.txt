[00:12:40.189] acceptable just to be clear but we're
[00:12:40.199] acceptable just to be clear but we're going to come to that because that's now
[00:12:42.269] going to come to that because that's now
[00:12:42.279] going to come to that because that's now that's many months later over a year

[00:14:44.670] later but I I come back to the point
[00:14:44.680] later but I I come back to the point that on October the 9th I believe
[00:14:47.350] that on October the 9th I believe
[00:14:47.360] that on October the 9th I believe absolutely Israel had the right to go
[00:14:49.310] absolutely Israel had the right to go
[00:14:49.320] absolutely Israel had the right to go after Hamas past their own border
[00:14:52.189] after Hamas past their own border
[00:14:52.199] after Hamas past their own border because Hamas had gone back into Gaza
[00:14:54.990] because Hamas had gone back into Gaza
[00:14:55.000] because Hamas had gone back into Gaza the people who perpetrated the terror
[00:14:56.509] the people who perpetrated the terror
[00:14:56.519] the people who perpetrated the terror attack thousands of them came in did it
[00:14:59.150] attack thousands of them came in did it
[00:14:59.160] attack thousands of them came in did it and then went back including 250
[00:15:00.829] and then went back including 250
[00:15:00.839] and then went back including 250 hostages absolutely Israel had the right
[00:15:03.110] hostages absolutely Israel had the right
[00:15:03.120] hostages absolutely Israel had the right to do that and the ICC hasn't said they
[00:15:05.069] to do that and the ICC hasn't said they
[00:15:05.079] to do that and the ICC hasn't said they didn't have the right to do that so it's
[00:15:07.150] didn't have the right to do that so it's
[00:15:07.160] didn't have the right to do that so it's interesting to me that you you know
[00:15:09.069] interesting to me that you you know
[00:15:09.079] interesting to me that you you know you're on the UN doesn't judge this but
[00:15:11.710] you're on the UN doesn't judge this but
[00:15:11.720] you're on the UN doesn't judge this but you seem to think I mean look I'm not I

[00:42:34.839] as a journalist I'm like what are they hiding
[00:42:36.150] hiding
[00:42:36.160] hiding yeah yeah yeah I I I you know and we've
[00:42:39.069] yeah yeah yeah I I I you know and we've
[00:42:39.079] yeah yeah yeah I I I you know and we've had this conversation in the past pi and
[00:42:41.069] had this conversation in the past pi and
[00:42:41.079] had this conversation in the past pi and I said that the same thing that I'm
[00:42:42.750] I said that the same thing that I'm
[00:42:42.760] I said that the same thing that I'm going to say to you now that I think
[00:42:45.349] going to say to you now that I think
[00:42:45.359] going to say to you now that I think that you have a point and I've
[00:42:47.190] that you have a point and I've
[00:42:47.200] that you have a point and I've recommended for the IDF to and the
[00:42:49.309] recommended for the IDF to and the
[00:42:49.319] recommended for the IDF to and the Israeli government to allow more media
[00:42:51.390] Israeli government to allow more media
[00:42:51.400] Israeli government to allow more media in but there's a reason they're not
[00:42:52.750] in but there's a reason they're not
[00:42:52.760] in but there's a reason they're not doing it without that agree well I'm
[00:42:56.150] doing it without that agree well I'm
[00:42:56.160] doing it without that agree well I'm sure that there are reasons
[00:42:57.670] sure that there are reasons
[00:42:57.680] sure that there are reasons a that it's Messy B that it's a quite a
[00:43:00.109] a that it's Messy B that it's a quite a
[00:43:00.119] a that it's Messy B that it's a quite a logistical
[00:43:01.549] logistical
[00:43:01.559] logistical responsibility sorry but that doesn't
[00:43:03.349] responsibility sorry but that doesn't
[00:43:03.359] responsibility sorry but that doesn't apply to other that didn't apply in Iraq
[00:43:05.950] apply to other that didn't apply in Iraq
[00:43:05.960] apply to other that didn't apply in Iraq it didn't apply in Afghanistan it hasn't
[00:43:07.549] it didn't apply in Afghanistan it hasn't
[00:43:07.559] it didn't apply in Afghanistan it hasn't applied in any modern war zone that I
[00:43:09.510] applied in any modern war zone that I
[00:43:09.520] applied in any modern war zone that I can think of the IDF has completely
[00:43:11.750] can think of the IDF has completely
[00:43:11.760] can think of the IDF has completely controlled whole war in Gaza and by not
[00:43:14.430] controlled whole war in Gaza and by not
[00:43:14.440] controlled whole war in Gaza and by not letting the media in I'm afraid the the
[00:43:17.109] letting the media in I'm afraid the the
[00:43:17.119] letting the media in I'm afraid the the longer it goes on where the IDF don't
[00:43:19.829] longer it goes on where the IDF don't
[00:43:19.839] longer it goes on where the IDF don't let Media in from around the world to
[00:43:22.190] let Media in from around the world to
[00:43:22.200] let Media in from around the world to actually verify what they claim is
[00:43:24.150] actually verify what they claim is
[00:43:24.160] actually verify what they claim is happening there then the more that
[00:43:25.829] happening there then the more that
[00:43:25.839] happening there then the more that people are going to think there is no
[00:43:27.589] people are going to think there is no
[00:43:27.599] people are going to think there is no smoke without fire and when you get the
[00:43:29.630] smoke without fire and when you get the
[00:43:29.640] smoke without fire and when you get the IC now launching these charges they're
[00:43:32.630] IC now launching these charges they're
[00:43:32.640] IC now launching these charges they're going to put those two things together
[00:43:34.390] going to put those two things together
[00:43:34.400] going to put those two things together and Israel is going to be suffering as
[00:43:36.270] and Israel is going to be suffering as
[00:43:36.280] and Israel is going to be suffering as it is and so my question again as
[00:43:39.030] it is and so my question again as

[00:55:55.870] that one word that hasn't been mentioned
[00:55:55.880] that one word that hasn't been mentioned on this whole show is the cause of all
[00:55:58.150] on this whole show is the cause of all
[00:55:58.160] on this whole show is the cause of all of these problems namely Iran Iran
[00:56:01.230] of these problems namely Iran Iran
[00:56:01.240] of these problems namely Iran Iran hasn't been mentioned the IC hasn't
