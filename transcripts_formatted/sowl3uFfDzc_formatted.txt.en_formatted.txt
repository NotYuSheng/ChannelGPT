[00:03:10.309] where it now is in my opinion speaking
[00:03:10.319] where it now is in my opinion speaking the basis of what Israeli leaders
[00:03:12.789] the basis of what Israeli leaders
[00:03:12.799] the basis of what Israeli leaders leaders themselves said after October
[00:03:15.509] leaders themselves said after October
[00:03:15.519] leaders themselves said after October 7th this isn't a war against Hamas this
[00:03:18.949] 7th this isn't a war against Hamas this
[00:03:18.959] 7th this isn't a war against Hamas this is a war against Gaza in fact it's not a
[00:03:22.550] is a war against Gaza in fact it's not a
[00:03:22.560] is a war against Gaza in fact it's not a war at all it's a
[00:03:24.390] war at all it's a
[00:03:24.400] war at all it's a genocide and in the course of that
[00:03:27.229] genocide and in the course of that
[00:03:27.239] genocide and in the course of that genocide we could say as of now the best
[00:03:30.350] genocide we could say as of now the best
[00:03:30.360] genocide we could say as of now the best estimates are there are about 42 million
[00:03:33.589] estimates are there are about 42 million
[00:03:33.599] estimates are there are about 42 million tons of rubble in Gaza it would take
[00:03:36.470] tons of rubble in Gaza it would take
[00:03:36.480] tons of rubble in Gaza it would take about 10 to 15 years to clear out the
[00:03:39.390] about 10 to 15 years to clear out the
[00:03:39.400] about 10 to 15 years to clear out the rubble and even if the rubble were
[00:03:41.750] rubble and even if the rubble were
[00:03:41.760] rubble and even if the rubble were cleared out there are no prospects for
[00:03:43.789] cleared out there are no prospects for
[00:03:43.799] cleared out there are no prospects for rebuilding Gaza because Israel will
[00:03:46.509] rebuilding Gaza because Israel will
[00:03:46.519] rebuilding Gaza because Israel will claim that any cement that enters Gaza
[00:03:49.429] claim that any cement that enters Gaza
[00:03:49.439] claim that any cement that enters Gaza will be used to build tunnels and so
[00:03:51.670] will be used to build tunnels and so
[00:03:51.680] will be used to build tunnels and so they'll bar cement as they did after
[00:03:54.149] they'll bar cement as they did after
[00:03:54.159] they'll bar cement as they did after operation protect cast lead in

[00:03:57.640] operation protect cast lead in 20089 so where we are now I would say
[00:04:01.350] 20089 so where we are now I would say
[00:04:01.360] 20089 so where we are now I would say Gaza is no more uh Gaza has been
[00:04:05.190] Gaza is no more uh Gaza has been
[00:04:05.200] Gaza is no more uh Gaza has been pulverized it's been obliterated and
