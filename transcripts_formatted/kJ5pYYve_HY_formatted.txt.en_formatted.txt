[00:05:58.110] but in terms of this deal that zalinski
[00:05:58.120] but in terms of this deal that zalinski seemed to be putting forward
[00:06:00.230] seemed to be putting forward
[00:06:00.240] seemed to be putting forward where Putin would keep the land that
[00:06:02.189] where Putin would keep the land that
[00:06:02.199] where Putin would keep the land that he's taken but that the rest of Ukraine

[00:06:08.070] you think that's something that Putin
[00:06:08.080] you think that's something that Putin would even consider as part of a peace
[00:06:11.830] would even consider as part of a peace
[00:06:11.840] would even consider as part of a peace settlement oh I really don't know I I

[00:06:24.589] joining the NATO alliance um I certainly
[00:06:24.599] joining the NATO alliance um I certainly hope that Trump would not entertain that
[00:06:27.230] hope that Trump would not entertain that
[00:06:27.240] hope that Trump would not entertain that um that's what this has been largely
[00:06:30.150] um that's what this has been largely
[00:06:30.160] um that's what this has been largely about of course along with um the
[00:06:33.150] about of course along with um the

[00:08:33.949] the withdrawal I could go on for an hour
[00:08:33.959] the withdrawal I could go on for an hour about that but Trump was willing to say
[00:08:37.469] about that but Trump was willing to say
[00:08:37.479] about that but Trump was willing to say you know what we lost we're not keeping

[00:08:44.279] trying now and Biden it was really the best thing Biden ever did his life was
[00:08:46.110] best thing Biden ever did his life was
[00:08:46.120] best thing Biden ever did his life was agree with that even though he botched
[00:08:48.190] agree with that even though he botched
[00:08:48.200] agree with that even though he botched the process of the withdrawal and so
[00:08:50.150] the process of the withdrawal and so

[00:08:52.110] it's the same kind of thing here it's a
[00:08:52.120] it's the same kind of thing here it's a it is a real tragedy what the Biden
[00:08:54.829] it is a real tragedy what the Biden
[00:08:54.839] it is a real tragedy what the Biden Administration has gotten the country of
[00:08:57.630] Administration has gotten the country of
[00:08:57.640] Administration has gotten the country of Ukraine into here check I mean it look
[00:09:01.150] Ukraine into here check I mean it look
[00:09:01.160] Ukraine into here check I mean it look every part of me is like I don't want to
[00:09:05.110] every part of me is like I don't want to
[00:09:05.120] every part of me is like I don't want to give a Russian dictator who's illegally

[00:09:07.839] give a Russian dictator who's illegally in my view invaded a sovereign
[00:09:10.069] in my view invaded a sovereign
[00:09:10.079] in my view invaded a sovereign Democratic European country that's been
[00:09:12.069] Democratic European country that's been
[00:09:12.079] Democratic European country that's been independent since the mid90s I don't
[00:09:14.389] independent since the mid90s I don't
[00:09:14.399] independent since the mid90s I don't want to give him an inch of that land
[00:09:16.069] want to give him an inch of that land
[00:09:16.079] want to give him an inch of that land that he's stolen with his murderous
[00:09:18.030] that he's stolen with his murderous
[00:09:18.040] that he's stolen with his murderous Rampage but there comes in war you know
[00:09:19.949] Rampage but there comes in war you know
[00:09:19.959] Rampage but there comes in war you know I've got a lot of military in my family
[00:09:22.110] I've got a lot of military in my family
[00:09:22.120] I've got a lot of military in my family there comes in war a cold hard reality
[00:09:24.269] there comes in war a cold hard reality
[00:09:24.279] there comes in war a cold hard reality check as Anna was alluding to earlier
[00:09:27.430] check as Anna was alluding to earlier
[00:09:27.440] check as Anna was alluding to earlier where we are where we are you know we
[00:09:29.470] where we are where we are you know we
[00:09:29.480] where we are where we are you know we can all be idealistic about what we'd
[00:09:31.470] can all be idealistic about what we'd
[00:09:31.480] can all be idealistic about what we'd like to happen but the reality is that
[00:09:33.990] like to happen but the reality is that
[00:09:34.000] like to happen but the reality is that it is highly unlikely now I think that
[00:09:36.710] it is highly unlikely now I think that
[00:09:36.720] it is highly unlikely now I think that Ukraine without a massive extra support
[00:09:40.509] Ukraine without a massive extra support
[00:09:40.519] Ukraine without a massive extra support from the likes of America which is
[00:09:42.509] from the likes of America which is
[00:09:42.519] from the likes of America which is simply not going to come that it is it
[00:09:44.949] simply not going to come that it is it
[00:09:44.959] simply not going to come that it is it is a case if Putin will probably be able
[00:09:47.430] is a case if Putin will probably be able
[00:09:47.440] is a case if Putin will probably be able to keep what he's taken is that your
[00:09:49.590] to keep what he's taken is that your
[00:09:49.600] to keep what he's taken is that your assessment and is that right for the
[00:09:51.190] assessment and is that right for the
[00:09:51.200] assessment and is that right for the world that we give him this big win
[00:09:54.069] world that we give him this big win
[00:09:54.079] world that we give him this big win which is effectively how he will portray
[00:09:56.269] which is effectively how he will portray
[00:09:56.279] which is effectively how he will portray it
[00:10:02.030] yeah that is my assessment and so the
[00:10:02.040] yeah that is my assessment and so the reality on the ground is that when Trump
[00:10:03.790] reality on the ground is that when Trump
[00:10:03.800] reality on the ground is that when Trump won uh we lost about 20% of Ukraine now
[00:10:08.310] won uh we lost about 20% of Ukraine now
[00:10:08.320] won uh we lost about 20% of Ukraine now uh there's a good argument to be made
[00:10:09.790] uh there's a good argument to be made
[00:10:09.800] uh there's a good argument to be made that you had already lost that 20% of
[00:10:11.550] that you had already lost that 20% of
[00:10:11.560] that you had already lost that 20% of Ukraine and you were never going to get
[00:10:12.750] Ukraine and you were never going to get
[00:10:12.760] Ukraine and you were never going to get it back because of the military
[00:10:14.310] it back because of the military
[00:10:14.320] it back because of the military realities on the ground so you know it's
[00:10:17.630] realities on the ground so you know it's
[00:10:17.640] realities on the ground so you know it's this has been a very very difficult
[00:10:19.670] this has been a very very difficult
[00:10:19.680] this has been a very very difficult question because uh the US did push
[00:10:22.630] question because uh the US did push
[00:10:22.640] question because uh the US did push Russia too much we did push NATO to its
[00:10:25.030] Russia too much we did push NATO to its
[00:10:25.040] Russia too much we did push NATO to its borders when we said we wouldn't I
[00:10:27.150] borders when we said we wouldn't I
[00:10:27.160] borders when we said we wouldn't I understand all that but at the end of
[00:10:28.190] understand all that but at the end of
[00:10:28.200] understand all that but at the end of the day the Russians invaded
[00:10:30.030] the day the Russians invaded
[00:10:30.040] the day the Russians invaded and it's not an anti-war position to
[00:10:31.710] and it's not an anti-war position to
[00:10:31.720] and it's not an anti-war position to start a war so Putin is definitely
[00:10:34.269] start a war so Putin is definitely
[00:10:34.279] start a war so Putin is definitely guilty and add on top of that 12,000
[00:10:37.269] guilty and add on top of that 12,000
[00:10:37.279] guilty and add on top of that 12,000 civilians killed at on top of that
[00:10:38.790] civilians killed at on top of that
[00:10:38.800] civilians killed at on top of that 20,000 Ukrainian children kidnapped but
[00:10:42.389] 20,000 Ukrainian children kidnapped but
[00:10:42.399] 20,000 Ukrainian children kidnapped but what's the answer is the answer to fight
[00:10:44.030] what's the answer is the answer to fight
[00:10:44.040] what's the answer is the answer to fight for the next 10 years 20 years is the
[00:10:46.509] for the next 10 years 20 years is the
[00:10:46.519] for the next 10 years 20 years is the answer to seed ground to Putin well
[00:10:48.269] answer to seed ground to Putin well
[00:10:48.279] answer to seed ground to Putin well that's also super dangerous that's why
[00:10:50.430] that's also super dangerous that's why
[00:10:50.440] that's also super dangerous that's why this is an unsolvable riddle because you
[00:10:52.190] this is an unsolvable riddle because you
[00:10:52.200] this is an unsolvable riddle because you can get to peace now by doing what Trump
[00:10:54.670] can get to peace now by doing what Trump
[00:10:54.680] can get to peace now by doing what Trump is likely going to do which is Russia
[00:10:56.350] is likely going to do which is Russia
[00:10:56.360] is likely going to do which is Russia take 20% of it and uh n and it and
[00:10:59.990] take 20% of it and uh n and it and
[00:11:00.000] take 20% of it and uh n and it and Ukraine will not join NATO but the next
[00:11:03.430] Ukraine will not join NATO but the next
[00:11:03.440] Ukraine will not join NATO but the next time Russia thinks about invading a
[00:11:04.829] time Russia thinks about invading a
[00:11:04.839] time Russia thinks about invading a country they're going to think well we
[00:11:06.350] country they're going to think well we
[00:11:06.360] country they're going to think well we went into Georgia and took a chunk we
[00:11:08.750] went into Georgia and took a chunk we
[00:11:08.760] went into Georgia and took a chunk we went into Crimea took it all you know

[00:11:13.150] when it was part of Ukraine we went into
[00:11:13.160] when it was part of Ukraine we went into Ukraine again we took 20% of it it turns
[00:11:16.069] Ukraine again we took 20% of it it turns
[00:11:16.079] Ukraine again we took 20% of it it turns out aggression is rewarded and and
[00:11:18.949] out aggression is rewarded and and
[00:11:18.959] out aggression is rewarded and and Netanyahu is watching and he's going to

[00:57:25.069] difference in prosperity is marked and
[00:57:25.079] difference in prosperity is marked and it's marked because
[00:57:26.829] it's marked because
[00:57:26.839] it's marked because uh Ukraine hasn't had the protection of
[00:57:30.230] uh Ukraine hasn't had the protection of
[00:57:30.240] uh Ukraine hasn't had the protection of the European Union and NATO and that's
[00:57:32.789] the European Union and NATO and that's
[00:57:32.799] the European Union and NATO and that's why the people in 2014 2013 and maidon
[00:57:36.589] why the people in 2014 2013 and maidon
[00:57:36.599] why the people in 2014 2013 and maidon they saw this Ukraine and Poland were
[00:57:39.829] they saw this Ukraine and Poland were
[00:57:39.839] they saw this Ukraine and Poland were economically similar in the 1980s but by

[00:57:47.230] 2014 Poland's GDP per capita was two or
[00:57:47.240] 2014 Poland's GDP per capita was two or three times what it was in Ukraine
[00:57:49.430] three times what it was in Ukraine
[00:57:49.440] three times what it was in Ukraine simply because that Poland had the
[00:57:52.470] simply because that Poland had the
[00:57:52.480] simply because that Poland had the association with the West with its
[00:57:54.150] association with the West with its

[00:59:27.190] no sense this was coming at all I mean
[00:59:27.200] no sense this was coming at all I mean there's nothing in the Korean media

[00:59:31.400] did it at 10:00 at night half the country woke was asleep woke up the next
[00:59:32.950] country woke was asleep woke up the next
[00:59:32.960] country woke was asleep woke up the next morning they were like what was going on
[00:59:34.630] morning they were like what was going on
[00:59:34.640] morning they were like what was going on you know I mean it was just a complete
[00:59:36.349] you know I mean it was just a complete
[00:59:36.359] you know I mean it was just a complete shock out of the blue which you've seen
[00:59:37.670] shock out of the blue which you've seen
[00:59:37.680] shock out of the blue which you've seen in the media coverage all over the world
[00:59:39.069] in the media coverage all over the world
[00:59:39.079] in the media coverage all over the world nobody really had any sense that this
[00:59:40.910] nobody really had any sense that this
[00:59:40.920] nobody really had any sense that this was coming at all and and you know
[00:59:42.630] was coming at all and and you know
[00:59:42.640] was coming at all and and you know because it was so drastic and sharp and
[00:59:44.630] because it was so drastic and sharp and
[00:59:44.640] because it was so drastic and sharp and extreme I think it you know collapsed
[00:59:46.270] extreme I think it you know collapsed
[00:59:46.280] extreme I think it you know collapsed almost as rapidly because the South
[00:59:48.109] almost as rapidly because the South
[00:59:48.119] almost as rapidly because the South Korean Parliament was like just like you
[00:59:49.870] Korean Parliament was like just like you
[00:59:49.880] Korean Parliament was like just like you like what the hell is this right and and
[00:59:51.390] like what the hell is this right and and
[00:59:51.400] like what the hell is this right and and they voted against it is it likely that
[00:59:54.549] they voted against it is it likely that
[00:59:54.559] they voted against it is it likely that this guy will now in to be be removed
[00:59:57.670] this guy will now in to be be removed
[00:59:57.680] this guy will now in to be be removed from office sooner rather than
[00:59:59.390] from office sooner rather than
[00:59:59.400] from office sooner rather than later yes I would imagine South Korea
[01:00:02.029] later yes I would imagine South Korea
[01:00:02.039] later yes I would imagine South Korea went through an entire impeachment cycle
[01:00:03.430] went through an entire impeachment cycle
[01:00:03.440] went through an entire impeachment cycle with a president just seven years ago so
[01:00:05.470] with a president just seven years ago so
[01:00:05.480] with a president just seven years ago so there's a practiced template if you will
[01:00:07.950] there's a practiced template if you will
[01:00:07.960] there's a practiced template if you will for removing a president they've done it
[01:00:10.470] for removing a president they've done it
[01:00:10.480] for removing a president they've done it and this is far this his offenses are
[01:00:12.630] and this is far this his offenses are
[01:00:12.640] and this is far this his offenses are far greater than than what she did seven
[01:00:14.750] far greater than than what she did seven
[01:00:14.760] far greater than than what she did seven years ago her name was Puck and hey y
[01:00:16.549] years ago her name was Puck and hey y
[01:00:16.559] years ago her name was Puck and hey y has gone far beyond that right I mean
[01:00:17.870] has gone far beyond that right I mean
[01:00:17.880] has gone far beyond that right I mean this is widely considered to be an
[01:00:19.510] this is widely considered to be an
[01:00:19.520] this is widely considered to be an enormous overreaction and I would be
[01:00:21.309] enormous overreaction and I would be
[01:00:21.319] enormous overreaction and I would be amazed if he doesn't resign in the next
[01:00:23.190] amazed if he doesn't resign in the next
[01:00:23.200] amazed if he doesn't resign in the next 10 days if he if he chooses to stay and
[01:00:25.510] 10 days if he if he chooses to stay and
[01:00:25.520] 10 days if he if he chooses to stay and fight it out I imagine the impeachment
[01:00:27.029] fight it out I imagine the impeachment
[01:00:27.039] fight it out I imagine the impeachment will be much faster than last time I bet
[01:00:28.950] will be much faster than last time I bet
[01:00:28.960] will be much faster than last time I bet he'll be gone by the end of January
[01:00:30.829] he'll be gone by the end of January
[01:00:30.839] he'll be gone by the end of January there are three different countries who
[01:00:32.710] there are three different countries who
[01:00:32.720] there are three different countries who be looking at this with great particular
[01:00:34.549] be looking at this with great particular
[01:00:34.559] be looking at this with great particular personal interest the United States you
[01:00:36.750] personal interest the United States you
[01:00:36.760] personal interest the United States you have 25,000 troops there on that border
[01:00:40.950] have 25,000 troops there on that border
[01:00:40.960] have 25,000 troops there on that border North Korea obviously who might be
[01:00:42.710] North Korea obviously who might be
[01:00:42.720] North Korea obviously who might be sensing an opportunity of very weak uh
[01:00:45.829] sensing an opportunity of very weak uh
[01:00:45.839] sensing an opportunity of very weak uh and vulnerable South Korea and China
[01:00:48.270] and vulnerable South Korea and China
[01:00:48.280] and vulnerable South Korea and China presume would be looking at all this as
[01:00:49.750] presume would be looking at all this as
[01:00:49.760] presume would be looking at all this as well is there likely to be any uh larger
[01:00:53.589] well is there likely to be any uh larger
[01:00:53.599] well is there likely to be any uh larger repercussion from this involving any of
[01:00:55.430] repercussion from this involving any of
[01:00:55.440] repercussion from this involving any of those three
[01:00:56.510] those three
[01:00:56.520] those three countries because it collapsed so fast
[01:00:58.750] countries because it collapsed so fast
[01:00:58.760] countries because it collapsed so fast I'm not really sure whenever the the
[01:01:00.470] I'm not really sure whenever the the
[01:01:00.480] I'm not really sure whenever the the South Koreans have sort of trouble
[01:01:01.549] South Koreans have sort of trouble
[01:01:01.559] South Koreans have sort of trouble there's concern the North Koreans might
[01:01:02.870] there's concern the North Koreans might
[01:01:02.880] there's concern the North Koreans might do something the North Koreans are a bit
[01:01:04.630] do something the North Koreans are a bit
[01:01:04.640] do something the North Koreans are a bit stretched right now because they're so
[01:01:06.190] stretched right now because they're so
[01:01:06.200] stretched right now because they're so they're getting pulled into this Ukraine
[01:01:07.750] they're getting pulled into this Ukraine
[01:01:07.760] they're getting pulled into this Ukraine mess right I would be surprised if the
[01:01:09.349] mess right I would be surprised if the
[01:01:09.359] mess right I would be surprised if the north korean's taking advantage of this
[01:01:11.029] north korean's taking advantage of this
[01:01:11.039] north korean's taking advantage of this there hasn't been anything in the last
[01:01:12.349] there hasn't been anything in the last
[01:01:12.359] there hasn't been anything in the last 24 hours um but you know they might I
[01:01:14.910] 24 hours um but you know they might I
[01:01:14.920] 24 hours um but you know they might I mean the North Koreans are great
[01:01:16.190] mean the North Koreans are great
[01:01:16.200] mean the North Koreans are great provocators um the Americans I'm a
[01:01:18.230] provocators um the Americans I'm a
[01:01:18.240] provocators um the Americans I'm a little bit surprised that the Biden
[01:01:19.349] little bit surprised that the Biden
[01:01:19.359] little bit surprised that the Biden Administration didn't really say too
[01:01:20.870] Administration didn't really say too
[01:01:20.880] Administration didn't really say too much initially I think the Americans
[01:01:22.510] much initially I think the Americans
[01:01:22.520] much initially I think the Americans were kind of Ted on this I think the
[01:01:23.990] were kind of Ted on this I think the
[01:01:24.000] were kind of Ted on this I think the Biden people are going to get some
[01:01:24.950] Biden people are going to get some
[01:01:24.960] Biden people are going to get some criticism for that but I think to a
[01:01:26.870] criticism for that but I think to a
[01:01:26.880] criticism for that but I think to a certain extent that's kind of
[01:01:27.870] certain extent that's kind of
[01:01:27.880] certain extent that's kind of understandable because nobody really
[01:01:28.829] understandable because nobody really
[01:01:28.839] understandable because nobody really knew quite what this was right it's like
[01:01:30.390] knew quite what this was right it's like
[01:01:30.400] knew quite what this was right it's like all of a sudden president goes on
[01:01:31.750] all of a sudden president goes on
[01:01:31.760] all of a sudden president goes on martial law and everybody's like what is
[01:01:33.549] martial law and everybody's like what is
[01:01:33.559] martial law and everybody's like what is this just like you said and and so I
[01:01:35.349] this just like you said and and so I
[01:01:35.359] this just like you said and and so I think the Biden people will get a little
[01:01:36.789] think the Biden people will get a little
[01:01:36.799] think the Biden people will get a little bit of sort of Grace on that one and
[01:01:38.829] bit of sort of Grace on that one and
[01:01:38.839] bit of sort of Grace on that one and again it sort of fell fell apart so
[01:01:40.589] again it sort of fell fell apart so
[01:01:40.599] again it sort of fell fell apart so rapidly so you know normality has kind
[01:01:42.349] rapidly so you know normality has kind
[01:01:42.359] rapidly so you know normality has kind of come back you know the stock market

[01:01:48.549] slipped but I don't see any big foreign
[01:01:48.559] slipped but I don't see any big foreign breach at the moment um because it fell
[01:01:51.950] breach at the moment um because it fell
[01:01:51.960] breach at the moment um because it fell apart so rapidly but you know if the
[01:01:53.670] apart so rapidly but you know if the
[01:01:53.680] apart so rapidly but you know if the tanks had stayed on the streets then
