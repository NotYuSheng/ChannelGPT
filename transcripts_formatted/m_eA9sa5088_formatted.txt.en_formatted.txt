[00:10:07.509] a dangerous guy as far as I'm
[00:10:07.519] a dangerous guy as far as I'm concerned well I think he's
[00:10:09.389] concerned well I think he's
[00:10:09.399] concerned well I think he's conditionally dangerous meaning that
[00:10:11.110] conditionally dangerous meaning that
[00:10:11.120] conditionally dangerous meaning that when he's in situations where his anger
[00:10:13.030] when he's in situations where his anger

[00:10:20.350] I'm sure he beat her all the time at
[00:10:20.360] I'm sure he beat her all the time at least that's what she alleged so I think
[00:10:22.310] least that's what she alleged so I think
[00:10:22.320] least that's what she alleged so I think that when when they're looking at
[00:10:23.829] that when when they're looking at
[00:10:23.839] that when when they're looking at whether or not he's consistently violent
[00:10:25.790] whether or not he's consistently violent
[00:10:25.800] whether or not he's consistently violent it's not like he's in the streets doing
[00:10:27.389] it's not like he's in the streets doing
[00:10:27.399] it's not like he's in the streets doing drrive by shootings and got bodies on
[00:10:29.350] drrive by shootings and got bodies on
[00:10:29.360] drrive by shootings and got bodies on his record so they're not going to
[00:10:30.790] his record so they're not going to
[00:10:30.800] his record so they're not going to consider him to be a present dangerous
[00:10:32.750] consider him to be a present dangerous
[00:10:32.760] consider him to be a present dangerous person however his financial means and
[00:10:36.150] person however his financial means and
[00:10:36.160] person however his financial means and the history of alleged things that he's
[00:10:38.509] the history of alleged things that he's

[00:10:41.710] people to commit crimes is the thing
[00:10:41.720] people to commit crimes is the thing that I think they should be most worried
[00:10:42.910] that I think they should be most worried
[00:10:42.920] that I think they should be most worried about P did he got a ton of money he got
[00:10:44.870] about P did he got a ton of money he got
[00:10:44.880] about P did he got a ton of money he got a ton of influence the reason people
[00:10:46.710] a ton of influence the reason people
[00:10:46.720] a ton of influence the reason people have been quiet so many years is because
[00:10:48.590] have been quiet so many years is because
[00:10:48.600] have been quiet so many years is because I I believe and this is my opinion I
